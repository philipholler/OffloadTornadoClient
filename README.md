# OffloadTornadoClient

This app was build as a frontend for university projekt regarding offloading of computation to mobile phones.

The app was build using OpenAPI Generator, kotlin and tornadofx.

The HTTPClient connects to a server generated by the same yaml file as the on here /resources/OpenAPI Generator/openapi-definition.yaml

The client as standard looks up the server at url: http://localhost:8080

# Run app
Use the run configuration **RUNAPP** found within /.run/RUNAPP.run.xml

Intellij should pick this up automatically.

Java-, kotlin and tornadofx versions can be found in /**pom.xml** 

# Update the HTTP Client
The HTTP client is generated using the files in /resources/OpenAPI Generator.

In order to run it, run command: 
```
java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -i openapi-definition.yaml -g kotlin
```

This will generate the new client to the resources/OpenAPI Generator folder.

From the generated copy everything inside src/main/kotlin/org/openapitools/client/ and replace everything inside the HTTPClient package with that content.
